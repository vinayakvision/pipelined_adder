## 📘 Project Overview

A **pipelined adder** is an optimized version of a digital adder that uses pipelining to improve the **speed** and **efficiency** of arithmetic operations in processors and digital circuits. Pipelining allows different stages of an operation to be performed concurrently, significantly increasing **throughput**.

## ⚙️ Pipelined Adder

### 📄 Description

Pipelining divides a complex task into smaller, sequential stages, enabling **concurrent execution** of operations. It's akin to an assembly line where each unit (stage) performs a specific part of the operation.

### 🧠 Key Concepts of Pipelining

- **Stages:** The task is broken into smaller parts.
- **Parallelism:** Different stages handle different tasks simultaneously.
- **Pipeline Registers:** Store intermediate results between stages.
- **Clock Cycles:** Sync stage transitions and data movement.
- **Throughput vs. Latency:** Higher throughput, but individual task latency may increase.

---

## 🧪 How it Works

- **Stage Division:** Each stage performs a portion of the addition.
- **Pipeline Registers:** Intermediate results flow through registers.
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple additions progress simultaneously.
- **Carry Propagation:** Managed efficiently across stages.
- **Final Result:** One new result per clock cycle after pipeline fill.

## 🔁 Comparison with Other Adders

| Adder Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)** | Simple, sequential carry propagation, slower for wider bit widths. |
| **Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)** | Fast carry computation using parallel logic, good for low latency. |
| **Carry Save Adder (CSA)** | Efficient for adding multiple numbers, used in multipliers. |
| **Parallel Prefix Adders (e.g. Kogge-Stone)** | Fast carry computation for wide inputs, complex structure. |
| **Modular Adders** | Useful in cryptography; includes modulus operation after addition. |
